# 6.1.3-Doubly-linked-lists-in-CPP
Implementation of doubly linked lists of different data types by using the std::list class template in C++.

In task 5.1, the student is assigned to implement a polymorphic doubly linked list struct named list for storing numbers of data types int, double and size_t. 
This project contains the corresponding C++ code, where three lists are filled with numbers and the respective list size is entered from the command line 
when running the program. The content of each list is printed in the terminal before the program terminates. 

The student is to imitate the functionality of the std::list class template by using unions.
